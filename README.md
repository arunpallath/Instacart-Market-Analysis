# Instacart Market Analysis

#### What is Instacart?

Instacart operates a grocery delivery and pick-up service in the United States and Canada. It operates in over 5,500 cities and its customers place orders through both website and mobile apps. Instacart partners with over 350 retailers that have more than 25K grocery stores. After the customer places their orders through the app, personal shoppers review your order and do the in-store shopping and delivery for you.

Instacart uses the order data from the customers to be able to understand customer purchase patterns. They use this data to learn about the products a user will buy again, or add to their cart next during a particular shopping session.

#### What are we trying to solve?

In this project, we will try and understand some patterns in customer behavior. Some of the questions we deal with in this project are :

What time and day of the week are the customers placing the orders?
What are the products which drive the orders i.e. products which make or break the order?
What are the products that are being re-ordered?
What percentage of products being ordered are perishables / non-perishables?
What are the departments / aisles that have the most number of orders? and re-orders?
Does the re-order ratio of products change by time or day of the week?
Is there any relation between the order in which the products are added to the cart with the re-order of that product?
How frequently does the customer place the order on the Instacart app?
How many products does a customer generally buy in each order?
Once we get a fair idea of the purchase pattern of the customers, we also build 3 models which will help us predict the customer behavior in the future. This will help Instacart while partnering with retailers. It also helps to get the products which need to be stocked up, cross sell products etc.
